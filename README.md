Kano and Abuja record the highest number of churns while Lagos has the lowest number

## Conclusion
The key financial and behavioural factors driving customer churn are high fees and poor services which suggests the increased switch to competitors. The number of customer churn across the four segments are closely matched but Retail remains the one with the highest number of churns. This customer churn results to 25.65% decrease in revenue growth

## Suggestion
Investigate the major reason why customers are switching to competitors and what the competitors seem to be doing better (better customer support/services, lower fees and charges, attractive offers like lower interest rates on loans, incentives)
Reassessment of service charges (monthly fees) and improvement of services.
